This is a sanitized dump of the entire Bell's Mind database as it existed on the
last day it was running.  The user password hashes, e-mail addresses, and other
personal information have been removed.  The scanned number recordings have also
been removed due to space concerns.

This data is being released so that people can play with it and get a glimpse
into what was going on behind the scenes on, at least what I'd like to think,
was the most popular phreaking site of its time.

There are no plans yet for Bell's Mind to come back as it was but this gets us
one step closer to having a resource back that a lot of people depended on for
a long time.  At the height of our popularity we averaged 10k page views per day
including all kinds of spidering traffic from hobbyists, hackers, phreakers, and
commercial ventures alike.  It's not a mind blowing amount of traffic but it was
a lot more than any of us ever expected when Bell's Mind grew out from the
original NPA.php.

Special thanks to:
  - dual parallel (AKA dual, <a href="http://twitter.com/getdual">@getdual</a>) for coming up with the original command line lookup tool that NPA.php was based off of
  - rax (AKA <a href="http://twitter.com/rax0r">rax0r</a>) for coming up with the name "Bell's Mind"
  - <a href="http://twitter.com/stankdawg">StankDawg</a> for building a community called BinRev that inspired me to build Bell's Mind for the benefit of everyone
  - One last person who would rather not be named.  You know who you are.  We had a lot of fun playing with all of this crap way back in the day.  I understand you can't be a part of it right now but any time you're ready to come back we're here.
